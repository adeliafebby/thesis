# Undergraduate Thesis: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Using Hybrid Approach

This repository contains the work from my undergraduate thesis, where I explore multivariate time series forecasting by combining a classic statistical method, Vector Autoregressive (VAR), with a deep learning technique, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The hybrid model leverages the strengths of both approaches to improve forecasting accuracy and handle complex time series data.
